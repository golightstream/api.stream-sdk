# API.stream SDK

The API.stream API enables development partners to quickly build web-based video workflows for streaming. Partners can focus their time developing vertical-specific features while utilizing API.streams's mature, tested, and feature-rich platform for composing layouts, integrating video sources and destinations, and controlling broadcasts.


### SDKs
- [JavaScript SDK](/sdk/js/)

### Examples
- [Scene composition](/examples/js/scenes)
- [Scene composition with WebRTC](/examples/js/scenes-webrtc)

## Features

### Live API

* publish any webpage to one or more live streaming destinations
* embed live streaming sources into a webpage
* fully-featured webrtc backend with interconnect to and from live streaming sources and destinations
* management of collections (of projects), projects (which contain broadcasts), and broadcasts
* fine-grain, role-backed permissions system for safely sharing projects with collaborators and guests
* real-time broadcast and user-definable event distribution

### Layout API

* low-level management of rendering-framework-agnostic data models for building compositions
* distributed composition primitives to enable collaboration
* fine-grain, role-backed permissions system for safely sharing projects with collaborators and guests
* user-definable event distribution
